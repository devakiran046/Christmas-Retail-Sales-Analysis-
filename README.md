# Christmas Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Server + Power BI)

## Project Description
This project is an end-to-end **retail analytics solution** built to analyze Christmas season sales data.  
The analysis focuses on understanding **sales trends, product performance, order behavior, promotions, and fulfillment efficiency**.

The project demonstrates how raw retail data can be transformed into **actionable business insights** using **Microsoft SQL Server** for analysis and **Power BI** for interactive visualization and storytelling.

##  Technology Stack
- **Microsoft SQL Server** – Data storage, transformation, and analysis  
- **SQL** – Business logic and insights generation  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards & reporting  
- **GitHub** – Version control and documentation  

##  Data Analysis Using MS SQL Server
The dataset was first uploaded into **Microsoft SQL Server**, where all major insights were derived using SQL before visualization.

### SQL Concepts Used
- `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`
- `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`)
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Window Functions** (`ROW_NUMBER`, `RANK`)
- Date functions for seasonal analysis
- Conditional logic using `CASE WHEN`

 **SQL Scripts:**  
All SQL queries used for this analysis are available in the [`/sql`](sql/) folder.

##  Power BI Dashboards
After completing the SQL analysis, the data was connected to **Power BI** to build interactive dashboards.
